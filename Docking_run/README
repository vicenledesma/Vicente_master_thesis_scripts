Script to dock multiple ligand into one receptor. THE RECEPTOR AND LIGAND MUST ALREADY BE CORRECTLY PROTONATED!
The protocol:
	* Flexible docking. Flexible side chains can be specified.
	* AD4 scoring function.
	* Exhaustiveness, num_modes and energy_range can be tuned.
	
It needs:
	* Receptor PDB file.
	* Ligand SDF files.
	* List of ligand names.
